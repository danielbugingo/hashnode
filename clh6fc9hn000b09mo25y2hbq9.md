### Introduction

Are you a beginner trying to learn ReactJs and stuck with an error message when setting up your first project? You're not alone. It can be frustrating to encounter roadblocks at the beginning of your journey. I felt excited about learning frontend development with ReactJs, only to receive a warning message while setting up my first project. Despite following recommendations to remove the global installation of `create-react-app`, the problem persisted. In this blog post, I'll share my experience and guide you through troubleshooting the issue.

Solving the problem of the warning message "**You are running** `create-react-app` **4.0.3, which is behind the latest release (5.0.1). We no longer support global installation of Create React App**" involves mainly three steps that need to be executed in a specific order. These steps are designed to remove any previous installation of create-react-app, clear the cache memory, and then reinstall **create-react-app** using **npx**.

### Uninstall the create-react-app

The first step is to remove any global installs of create-react-app. This is necessary because the warning message indicates that a previous version of create-react-app is installed, which is not compatible with the latest version. To remove any global installs, you can use one of the following commands, depending on the package manager you are using:

* `npm uninstall -g create-react-app`
    
* `yarn global remove create-react-app`
    

### Clear the cache memory

The second step is to clear the cache memory. This is important because **create-react-app** might still be referencing the old version that was uninstalled in the previous step. To clear the cache memory, you can use the command `npx clear-npx-cache`. This command clears the cache memory for **npx**, which is the package runner used to run create-react-app.

### Reinstall the react app

The third and final step is to reinstall **create-react-app** using **npx**. This is necessary because the previous version of **create-react-app** was uninstalled in step one, and clearing the cache memory in step two ensures that the latest version is downloaded. To reinstall, create-react-app using the command `npx create-react-app hello`, where "hello" is the name of your new react application.

### Conclusion

It's important to note that these three commands have to be run in the same order as outlined above. Removing any global installs of create-react-app ensures that there is no interference with the new installation. Clearing the cache memory ensures that the latest version is downloaded, and reinstalling **create-react-app** ensures that the new installation is complete. By following these three steps, you should be able to successfully install **create-react-app** without encountering any warning messages. Congratulations and happy coding
